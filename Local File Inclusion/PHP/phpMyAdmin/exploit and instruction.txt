Instruction:

Prepare the PHP Payload:

Execute the SQL query provided above to create a PHP file with the desired payload on the target server.
Identify the Session File:

Locate the session file on the server. Typically, session files are stored in /var/lib/php/sessions/, but the path might vary based on the server configuration.
Send the Exploit Request:

Construct and send the exploit request to the server using the URL format provided. Make sure to encode the target parameter to bypass any filtering:

GET /index.php?target=db_sql.php%253f/../../../../../../../../var/lib/php/sessions/sess_<session-id> HTTP/1.1
Host: <target-domain>
Connection: close

Verify the Execution:

Check if the PHP code (phpinfo();) from the payload is executed. This can typically be verified by examining the HTTP response or by observing any changes or effects caused by the payload.
