To install Windows on VirtualBox, follow these steps:

1. Download Windows ISO:
Go to https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/.
Download the Windows ISO file for the version you wish to install.
2. Create a New Virtual Machine:
Open VirtualBox.
Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
Enter a name (e.g., "Windows 10") and select "Windows" as the type and the appropriate version (e.g., "Windows 10 (64-bit)").
Click "Next."
3. Allocate Memory:
Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to the virtual machine (e.g., 4096 MB or more depending on your system resources).
Click "Next."
4. Create a Virtual Hard Disk:
Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
Choose the hard disk file type (e.g., VDI - VirtualBox Disk Image) and click "Next."
Select "Dynamically allocated" or "Fixed size" based on your preference, then click "Next."
Set the size of the virtual hard disk (e.g., 50 GB or more), then click "Create."
5. Configure Virtual Machine:
Select the newly created VM and click "Settings."
Go to "System" and adjust the boot order to ensure "Optical" is at the top if you're using an ISO.
Go to "Storage," click on the empty optical drive under "Controller: IDE," and then click on the disk icon next to "Optical Drive."
Choose "Choose a disk file" and select the downloaded Windows ISO.
Click "OK" to close the settings.
6. Start the Virtual Machine:
Select the VM and click "Start."
The VM will boot from the Windows ISO.
7. Install Windows:
Once Windows starts, you'll be presented with the installation screen.
Select your language, time, and keyboard preferences, then click "Next."
Click "Install now."
8. Enter Product Key:
If prompted, enter your Windows product key. If you don’t have one, you can choose "I don’t have a product key" and continue (you’ll need to activate Windows later).
9. Select Installation Type:
Choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" if you want a clean installation.
10. Partition the Virtual Disk:
Select the partition where you want to install Windows (usually the only option). Click "Next."
11. Complete Installation:
Windows will begin copying files and installing. This may take some time and the VM will restart several times during the process.
12. Set Up Windows:
Follow the on-screen prompts to set up Windows (create a user account, set a password, configure privacy settings, etc.).
13. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions (Recommended):
Once Windows is installed and running, click "Devices" in the VirtualBox menu.
Select "Insert Guest Additions CD image."
Follow the prompts inside the Windows VM to install the Guest Additions for better performance and additional features.
