To install Ubuntu on VirtualBox, follow these steps:

1. Download Ubuntu ISO:
Go to the https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop.
Download the latest Ubuntu Desktop ISO file.
2. Create a New Virtual Machine:
Open VirtualBox.
Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
Enter a name (e.g., "Ubuntu") and select "Linux" and "Ubuntu" (or "Ubuntu (64-bit)" depending on your ISO).
Click "Next."
3. Allocate Memory:
Choose the amount of RAM to allocate (e.g., 2048 MB or more depending on your system resources).
Click "Next."
4. Create a Virtual Hard Disk:
Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
Choose the hard disk file type (e.g., VDI - VirtualBox Disk Image) and click "Next."
Select "Dynamically allocated" or "Fixed size" based on your preference, then click "Next."
Set the size of the virtual hard disk (e.g., 20 GB or more), then click "Create."
5. Configure Virtual Machine:
Select the newly created VM and click "Settings."
Go to "System" and adjust the boot order to ensure "Optical" is at the top if you're using an ISO.
Go to "Storage," click on the empty optical drive under "Controller: IDE," and then click on the disk icon next to "Optical Drive."
Choose "Choose a disk file" and select the downloaded Ubuntu ISO.
Click "OK" to close the settings.
6. Start the Virtual Machine:
Select the VM and click "Start."
The VM will boot from the Ubuntu ISO.
7. Install Ubuntu:
Once Ubuntu starts, you'll be presented with the installation screen.
Choose "Install Ubuntu."
Select your preferred language and click "Continue."
Choose your keyboard layout and click "Continue."
Select "Normal installation" and check "Download updates while installing Ubuntu" if desired. Click "Continue."
Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" (this affects only the virtual disk, not your actual hard drive) and click "Install Now."
Confirm changes and click "Continue."
8. Follow Installation Prompts:
Select your time zone and click "Continue."
Enter your user information (name, computer name, username, password) and click "Continue."
9. Complete Installation:
Wait for the installation to complete. This may take several minutes.
Once done, you will be prompted to restart the VM. Click "Restart Now."
10. Remove ISO and Reboot:
After restarting, VirtualBox may prompt you to remove the installation media. Click "Remove" or "Continue."
Ubuntu should now boot from the virtual hard disk.
